Please visit the platform specific subdirectory to run the demo. If your
platform is a POSIX platform which is not listed, you could try the linux
subdirectory. The dependency is just SDL. If SDL can run on your platform then
you should have no issue getting this to work.

For Linux and OSX, you should just be able to execute the run.sh script to run
the demo as long as you have SDL installed and have it available to gcc.

Please reach out to me if you run into any issues on your platform.
