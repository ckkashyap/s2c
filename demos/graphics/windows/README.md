# Running the demo on windows

The instructions below assume that you have the 64 bit Microsoft C compiler set
in your path. You can do this by running "vcvarsall.bat x64" on the command
line.

1. Open a command prompt window and navigate to this directory.
2. Run run.bat

If all goes well, you should see a window rendered with the title "Graphics
demo". You may now edit render.scm in the parent directory to see the changes
reflect in the window in real time :)
