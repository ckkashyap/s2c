Given the power of lambda calculus, I can already see a number of directions in which one could take this project forward. However, I'd like to layout some guiding principles that would help with making decisions in future.

1. This project currently deals with three languages - Python, Scheme and C. A fourth language will not be included. This includes tools such as make.
2. Every change to this project will either retain or improve the readability of the code.
3. Will not impose any requirement for a particular platform - all platforms that support Python and C are equal.
4. This compiler will assume that one has to learn programming to write optimum programs and will not encourage the idea that compiler writers and regular programmers are different.
